== Rails For PHP Developers sample app

This is a sample app I created from reading the aforementioned book.
The source code is compliant to Ruby 3.2.6, as many of the examples have deprecated code
for current versions of Ruby
It also contains SOLR search capability, which was not mentioned, but I wanted to see
how to implement, and was successful
